# Wannabe Challenge

This is a technical challenge to validate my ability as a Backend Software Engineer which consists in:

- You have to choose the stack you will use and why you chose it.
- The API must have documentation on how to use it as if you are delivering this API to a Frontend Developer.
- We must integrate with a PostgreSQL database and build seeders to populate the database with the data we attach to this email.
- Proper use of git. Please don ÃÅt upload your project to GitHub with just one commit; we want to see how you use GitHub and how you document each change in your code.
