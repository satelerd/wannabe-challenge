# Wannabe Challenge

This is a technical challenge to validate my ability as a Backend Software Engineer which consists in:

- You have to choose the stack you will use and why you chose it.
- The API must have documentation on how to use it as if you are delivering this API to a Frontend Developer.
- We must integrate with a PostgreSQL database and build seeders to populate the database with the data we attach to this email.
- Proper use of git. Please don ÃÅt upload your project to GitHub with just one commit; we want to see how you use GitHub and how you document each change in your code.

## Challenge

### The Stack
This project was built using the Django Rest Framework.
I chose this stack because I find it very reasonable to build the type of REST API needed for this challenge. This is because it's easy to start developing (from scratch) and it has a readable code which makes it easy to setup and understand.

### The API Documentation
To acces the API you will need to run the server locally.
```python manage.py runserver```

Then you can access the endpoints at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/endpoint/

The API dives into 3 main sections (airports, airlines, and flights), each one with its own endpoints and can use the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.
- /api/airports: 
    example application/json content:
    ```
    {
        "iata_code": "string",
        "airport": "string",
        "city": "string",
        "state": "string",
        "country": "string",
        "latitude": float,
        "longitude": float
    }
    ```



- /api/airlines
    example application/json content:
    ```
    {
        "iata_code": "string",
        "airline": "string"
    }
    ```

- /api/flights
    example application/json content:
    ```
    {
        "year": int,
        "month": int,
        "day": int,
        "day_of_week": int,
        "airline": string,
        "flight_number": int,
        "tail_number": "string",
        "origin_airport": "string",
        "destination_airport": "string",
        "scheduled_departure": "string",
        "departure_time": "string",
        "departure_delay": float,
        "taxi_out": float,
        "wheels_off": "string",
        "scheduled_time": float,
        "elapsed_time": float,
        "air_time": float,
        "distance": float,
        "wheels_on": "string",
        "taxi_in": float,
        "scheduled_arrival": "string",
        "arrival_time": "string",
        "arrival_delay": float,
        "diverted": boolean,
        "cancelled": boolean,
        "cancellation_reason": "string",
        "air_system_delay": float,
        "security_delay": float,
        "airline_delay": float,
        "late_aircraft_delay": float,
        "weather_delay": float
    }
    ```
